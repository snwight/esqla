===========

Using erlport [thank you Dmitry! hdima/erlport] to expose a grossly simplified subset of the SQLAlchemy Core API 
[an amazingly deep Python solution to an almost intractable set of RDBMS interface problems] to Erlang processes. 
Just a light-hearted experiment I've been thinking about.
